Description: The Bridge design pattern is a structural pattern that `decouples an abstraction from its implementation`, allowing both to vary independently. It is useful when you have multiple variants of an object and you want to `avoid the exponential growth of classes` that would occur using inheritance.

Bridge pattern is used when we need to `decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently`. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern decouples implementation class and abstract class by providing a bridge structure between them.
